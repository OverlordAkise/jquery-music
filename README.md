# jquery-music
A minimalistic music player using jQuery.

It uses jQuery to get every .mp3 file of the 'song' folder on your server.
It then plays them randomly from that folder and displays a list of them.
You can click the song names to jump straight to that specific song.

For a live preview visit my website [oblivion.at](http://oblivion.at/music).

The song in the 'song' folder is "Fake it till you make it" by DREAMERS.
Please support them if you like the song: [iTunes - Launch EP](https://itunes.apple.com/at/album/launch-ep/1406749855)

## Features in progress

Currently the songs are not being cached by the browser correctly, so if you get the same song twice after each other you still sometimes download them twice.

>Add internal caching for songs already listened to
>Add good looking CSS
>Make a non-copyright default song list for testing purposes
